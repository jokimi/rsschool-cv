# 👩 About myself:
Having started my career as a layout designer in a local newspaper with minimum skills, I became profficient in printing design. My keen interest in printing technologies led me to working as a Prepress and DTP Engineer in the largest printing house in my city, where I continued self-learning, examining the process of creating wine and food labels, magazines and other printed goods.

Remote work as a retoucher gives me extra free time, which I spend learning Frontend Development. I’m interested in Web Development because this occupation provides endless possibilities for professional growth, besides there’s a huge amount of free high quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers.

I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
